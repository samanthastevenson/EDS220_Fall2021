    "Let's get started with some data visualization and processing! Our tool for this exercise will be the Google Earth Engine (GEE):\n",
    "https://earthengine.google.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "GEE is a really powerful platform that allows easy access to many datasets without the need for a lot of pre-processing, so it's a good way to get our hands dirty with some basic mapping skills. Here we'll use the Python API, which will let us code in 'familiar' Python commands while still interfacing with the GEE platform. \n",

    "#### Recap from last time (GEE_Setup.ipynb)\n",
    "Prior to starting this notebook, you should have gone through the following steps:\n",
    "1. **Activating the Python environment containing your local GEE installation**\n",
    "   (on the command line in your terminal window) conda activate gee_env  \n",
    "   where \"gee_env\" is the name you gave to the environment creates for GEE to live in\n",
    "     \n",
    "2. **Authenticating Earth Engine**\n",
    "   (also on the terminal command line) earthengine authenticate  \n",
    "   This should bring up a login window in your Internet browser, where after entering your Google account information it will give you an authorization code to enter in the terminal\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. **Launching JupyterLab from within the appropriate Python environment**  \n",
    "   - If starting JupyterLab from the command line: make sure it says \"(gee_env)\" before your login name. This happens after the \"conda activate gee_env\" step, and your terminal prompt will look something like:  \n",
    "   (gee_env) Samanthas-MacBook-Pro:~ samstevenson$    \n",
    "     \n",
    "   - If starting JupyterLab from the Anaconda Navigator: make sure to go to the drop-down menu that says \"Applications on...\" and select \"gee_env\" before launching JupyterLab\n",

    "#### Importing Packages\n",
    "The code chunk below imports the needed packages: \n",
    "- **ee**, which covers the Google Earth Engine interface\n",
    "- **geemap**, which covers the GEE mapping functionality\n",
    "- **pandas**, to allow for manipulation of data subsets later on\n",
    "\n",
    "They're all included at the start of the notebook here, since it's good practice to do all of the importing of packages in one place (best at the beginning of the code) so you can easily see what tools are available to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in the GEE_Setup notebook, here 'pandas' is being imported with a shorter name 'pd' to make it easier to reference that package later on. This is done with the \"import...as\" syntax. note that you *could* do this with any of the other packages as well, and you can call them whatever you want!"

Here I'm going to tell it that I would like all of the ERA5 data: that means passing a location called \"ECMWF/ERA5/Daily\" that I got by poking through the [Earth Engine data catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/). There are also other ERA5 datasets: since we're going to explore precipitation, I'm using daily information so we can see individual rain events.\n",
